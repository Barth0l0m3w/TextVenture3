# TextVenture

small text-based game made in C++

to add to the game and put some text in you can put in what you want in 4 lines.
1: response from the person you are talking to
2: option 1 for the player
3: option 2 for the player
4: an empty line

within the code, you can add a message as m...(piece of text number)

and link it to the path of the story that it belongs to. 

at the moment not a lot of text has been implemented, so the game is not finished.
the functionality is there and can be easily added on.
